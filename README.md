# Minecraft Manhunt Plugin
This plugin allows your friends to hunt each other down while trying to finish Minecraft. I added a few features to take your minds of setting up the game and focus on the sheer terror you will feel, whenever you spot a nametag. Have fun!

## Features

- commands and gui
- set useful gamerules and time
- get new random spawn
- easy nether/end tracking
- tab completion for commands
- customizable freeze time
- easy to use

## Commands

- `/manhunt` opens gui
- `/manhunt hunter <name>` adds / removes hunter
- `/manhunt runner <name>` adds / removes runner
- `/manhunt reset` clears players and sets game rules
- `/manhunt spawn` get new random spawn
- `/manhunt start <seconds>` freeze time for hunters (default: 30 seconds)
- `/manhunt help` lists all commands

## Setup
Copy the `Manhunt.jar` into the plugins folder.
To access the gui Right/Left click the book or use the commands.

### Final words
This is my first plugin, so if there are any bugs or missing features feel free to contact me.
I had a blast creating this and testing it with my friends, and even though we never finished a game due to fall damage, lava or mobs, we really hope you have fun with your friends too.
Finally, I'd like to thank [Dream](https://www.youtube.com/c/dream) and his friends for all of those amazing manhunt videos and inspiring me to create this plugin.
